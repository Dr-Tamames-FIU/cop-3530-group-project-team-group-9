COP3530 Data Structures Flight Scheduling System Outline

Group Members:
•	Artur Kulgavtsev
•	Edison Garcia
•	Mahmoud Shebl

Objective: 
The objective of our project is to develop a robust Flight Scheduling System that leverages AVL Trees data structure to efficiently manage flight schedules. The system aims to provide a user-friendly interface for airlines and airport staff to effectively organize and retrieve flight information, ensuring smooth operations and optimal resource utilization.

Data Structures:
We will use AVL Trees to efficiently manage the flight schedules and ensure quick retrieval of flight information while maintaining balanced trees.

Structure:
•	Class Flight will represent individual flights and their details.
•	Class Airport will manage the airports and their schedules.
•	Class AVLTree will implement the AVL Tree data structure for efficient storage and retrieval of flight schedules.
•	Class FlightSchedulingSystemTest will contain test cases to verify the functionality of the Flight Scheduling System.

Other:
•	The program will include functionalities such as adding new flights, removing flights, updating flight details, searching for flights based on various criteria (e.g., destination, departure time), and displaying the flight schedule.
•	We will implement algorithms to balance the AVL Trees and ensure optimal performance.
•	Error handling will be implemented to manage cases such as invalid inputs or scheduling conflicts.
